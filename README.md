# Life in Weeks

A small project that visualizes lived and remaining time
based on a fixed lifespan assumption chosen by the user.

## What this is
A deterministic visualization of time progression.

## What this is not
- A death prediction tool
- A productivity tracker
- A motivational or behavioral app

## Core assumptions
- Lifespan is user-defined
- Time progresses deterministically
- No personalization or optimization

## MVP scope
- Birth date input
- Expected lifespan input
- Visual grid of weeks lived vs remaining

## Planned extensions
- Optional time-allocation lenses (sleep, eating)
